                            Despite the risk of arrest, organizers of a #BlackLivesMatter protest Tonia Conner and Vanessa Green, pushed to have protestors cross the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge starting from the entrance ramp in Tarrytown, New York on Apr. 7. Inspired in the wake of recent police shootings of Stephon Clark and Saheed Vassell, as well as the lack of representation of black women in the Women’s March national movement, Conner and Green gathered a group of over 100 protestors, beginning in the nearby CVS parking lot.

                            On April 20 and 21, Masters’ music ensembles came together for their annual joint performance of Great Gig in the Sky. In years past, the performance has contained songs only from one album. However, this year’s Great Gig was a playlist of songs by different artists, which all followed the theme of social justice. Some of those pieces performed included “The Star Spangled Banner” by Jimi Hendrix, “Freedom” by Beyoncé, and “Fortunate Son” By Creedence Clearwater Revival. Jeff Carnevale said, “I think what is really exciting about the performance this year is that it is a collection of songs that deal with social justice.” Originally, the album chosen was Beyonce’s Lemonade. Junior Elliott Feder said, “Considering the backlash that would have come from performing Lemonade, and the stress it caused for faculty, it was an easy switch and it had to be done.”

                            Before the 2018 Women’s March, I asked multiple people if they would be attending again this year, and many responses were, “I’m busy that day” or “I have too much work.” After hearing this type of response from many people and after not seeing nearly as much social media promotion as last year, I was concerned that this year’s march would not be as impactful or widespread as last year. When I took the subway down to 72nd street though, it was packed with pink hats and decorative signs with catchy slogans. Getting off the subway, I was met with police officers who telling everyone to walk up to 75th street, because 72nd street was already too full of marchers.

                        This year, the Boys Varsity Basketball team had an amazing season, which included winning the NYSAIS state championships. In the first round of playoff games, the team faced the Portledge School on Feb. 22 and was victorious, winning 73-48. “It was a team effort and we played great defense. We did a good job stopping their best player from scoring his usual 30 points and only let him score 20,” junior Rashid Woods said, who scored 16 points during the game. During the NYSAIS game, the crowd was electric. With fan buses transporting students to and from the game, many Masters students were present at the game. The Masters’ team constantly trailed the number one seeded Knox team. At halftime, the boys trailed 49-32. A similar deficit continued up to the last 5 minutes with the Knox School still leading 59-52. However, the tide started to turn when Masters took the lead for the first time in the game when Nick Torres Rivera ‘19 made 2 free throws.
